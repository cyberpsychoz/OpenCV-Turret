> **Version 0.3** — *Improved version with tracker and enhanced bandana detection*

This is an experimental project for a test turret that detects people wearing bandanas in video streams and can be used as a basis for target identification systems. The code is written in Python using OpenCV.

## 🧪 Features
- **YOLOv8 via Ultralytics**: Accurate person detection  
- **MediaPipe**: Body keypoint detection for precise head and hand localization  
- **Color classification**: Detection of bandanas across the entire body  
- **Kalman Filter**: Target motion prediction  
- **GPU acceleration**: CUDA support (NVIDIA only)  
- **Progress bar**: Shows processing percentage  

## ⚠️ Warning
- **Rough implementation** 🧪  
  Many features need refinement and optimization

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe ultralytics filterpy rich

# For Windows (headless version, no GUI)
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy mediapipe ultralytics filterpy rich
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place test videos into the `test_videos` folder  
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Processed videos will be saved to the `output` folder

## 📷 Example Output
```
[INFO] Found 2 videos for processing:
1. test1.mp4
2. test2.mp4

[INFO] Processing: test1.mp4

### 📌 Note for Windows users with AMD GPUs
OpenCV does not support CUDA on AMD GPUs. The code will automatically switch to CPU mode. For best performance, use a Windows system with an NVIDIA GPU or switch to Linux.
